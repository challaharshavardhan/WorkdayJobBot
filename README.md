# WorkdayJobBot
It is a job application bot that autofills the workday multiple pages, starting from login to answering your questions!

# Project Overview:

This is a Job Application Bot that was specifically designed for workday jobs. It auto detects the login page, my_information page, my_experience_page, and my_questionnaire_page, and enters the details of what you have submitted from the profile.json file. It was designed using Playwright and Node, and some JS. 

## NOTE:

We need to redesign for different pages(cuz Workday has different kinds of pages for different jobs and different DOM structures and uses dynamically created IDs, so it will be difficult but possible!), or if possible change the logic entirely.

## Conclusion:

Project is open for changes.
