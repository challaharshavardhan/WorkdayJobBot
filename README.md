# WorkdayJobBot
It is job application bot which autofills the workday multiple pages starting from login to answering your questions!
Project Overview:
This is a Task Tracker which uses gamification techniques to engage the users(i.e upgrade their characters as they progress), needs to submit proof of completion(image/small-video)to move to next day.

It is a Web Application project, where you can learn about MongoDb, Express, React, Node, AWS-S3 buckets, Firebase Authentication, RESTful API's, POSTMAN(If you're using it for API endpoint testing)

NOTE:
I didn't completely test it for 181 days myself

I need to change the task logic, when the person reaches 181 days, task should be deleted automatically, allowing the user for creating new tasks(person updating the logic can send a delete request to the backend at api/tasks/delete)

May be should have worked on with animations

Conclusion:
Project is open for changes.
